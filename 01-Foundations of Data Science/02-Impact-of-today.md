# Data-driven careers

Data professionals are so valuable to their companies. They determine which data streams are most important to specific business projects, challenges and initiatives. They identify key goals for the future and they give their organizations the ability to take meaningful action by reimagining processes and improving operations. To do all of this data teams require individuals with diverse skills, knowledge and interests. Therefore there are countless different data focused roles, responsibilities and project types which are further differentiated by the industries and businesses they support. Among all of these possibilities, data careers can be loosely categorized into two complementary types of work: technical and strategic. In this video we will investigate both. First let's find out about the folks whose work requires a heavy emphasis on technical skills. Some examples of these professionals are machine learning engineers and statisticians. These people provide high effort solutions to specific problems. Through their expertise in mathematics, statistics and computing, they build models and make predictions. Using tools such as R and python, they help their teams extract value from business data sets. The result is a solution that has a direct positive impact. Another highly technical role is the expert data analyst whose work involves exploring vast and complex datasets to identify directions worth pursuing in the first place. They ensure that an organization's data science efforts are directed as efficiently as possible, bridging the gap between other technical data professionals and the strategic work we'll cover shortly. Like most technical data professionals, you'll learn how to acquire scale, organize structure and manipulate data so that it's packaged in a way that others can work with. In other words, you'll know how to transform raw data into something useful for decision making. Okay, now let's consider data professionals on the more strategic side. These people include business intelligence professionals and technical project managers to name a couple. Strategic data professionals use their skills to interpret information that affects an organization's operations, finance research and development and so much more. Their work aligns closely to the overall business strategy and involves seeking solutions to problems through data analytics. In short, strategic data professionals maximize information to guide how a business works. Sometimes you'll find a company has roles that blend specialist technical knowledge with strategic data expertise, often in unusual and very creative ways. Soon we'll learn more about some of these opportunities as well as the more specialized technical and strategic roles. And of course we'll discover some proven ways to tap into them as a data professional. Lots more to come.

# How data drives modern business

Nowadays, it seems that data is generated everywhere. Computer functions have been integrated into a multitude of everyday technologies. Smart home voice assistance, step trackers, TV streaming apps, even some coffee makers are connected. All of these touchpoints create data that businesses can use to understand trends and advance their products and services. With every update, the ability to gather environmental and user data expands even further. Within this massive reserve of data is a wealth of untapped potential of waiting data professionals and the organizations they support. That's why these people are so in demand. Companies need them to use data to refine business strategies, meet consumer preferences, react to emerging trends, and re-align internal efforts. Let's consider some examples of how data professionals use their expertise to transform industries. First, the world of big finance was an early adopter of the power of data science. With the way information drives this industry, it's easy to understand why. Data professionals help financial institutions assess investment risks, monitor market trends, detect anomalies to reduce fraud, and create a more stable financial system overall. Hundreds of millions of financial transactions occur in the financial world each day, and data as part of each and every one of them. As another example, data analytics is key in health care. Here, the data benefits can actually be life-saving. For instance, the information collected by smartwatches is making a huge difference in the lives of many people. Sensors in these devices record biodata, such as heart rate and oxygen levels. Of course, all this information can be shared with health care professionals. Together, the patient and the physician can better understand sleep trends, stress levels, and much more. Then individualized wellness plans can be created and modified for the patient's well-being. Plus, on a larger scale, data analytics is helping health care organizations process large amounts of clinical data, which supports the early detection of a health condition and leads to more precise diagnosis. Thirdly, data has a big impact in manufacturing. Data professionals predict when to perform preventative maintenance to avoid production line breakdowns, use data to maximize quality assurance and defect tracking. Artificial intelligence models help respond to logistical issues and reduce delivery truck miles on the road, advancing key sustainability goals. In a time when supply chains reach every corner of the world, data enables clear and near real-time communication with suppliers, retailers, and other network partners. It also helps supply chains maintain optimal levels of inventory to avoid stock-outs and empty retail shelves. Data professionals are also advancing approaches to agriculture. With data insights, farmers develop new ways to approach crop production, livestock care, forestry, and agriculture. The inclusion of autonomous machinery, tractors and irrigation systems is improving harvesting technologies as well. If you'd like to keep learning about how various industries use data analytics, refer to the course resources on this topic. Here's a little piece of advice from me. Don't miss an opportunity to learn from someone in real life. I love asking business owners, store managers, and client support professionals about how they use data each and every day. Who knows? One of these conversations could open a door to a future opportunity for you.

# Data trends for the future
You have been learning how data professionals use their expertise to transform industries. Additionally, you’ve seen that data analytics roles can most often be classified as either technical or strategic. The field of data analytics is an emerging one, rich and expansive in its range of opportunities. In this reading, you will explore the future of data analytics careers by examining current industry trends.

Data
Data analytics has become a crucial component in modern business that informs data-driven decision-making and is a core element of how senior leaders understand and grow their businesses.

Considerations for the future
Big data is getting bigger. The need for people to understand, prioritize, manage, and analyze that information shows no signs of slowing down. Data analytics is helping to democratize data, allowing for more opportunities for insights. Organizations are building their data workforces and infrastructure to meet those needs.

Increasingly, companies are storing all of their raw data within large repositories accessible across the organization. A majority of today’s collected data is unstructured, which means that before it can be used in analysis, it will need to be structured and organized. These large-scale storage solutions, or data lakes, are becoming increasingly more common.

Data lakes can easily become more like data swamps, where searching and extracting data becomes significantly more difficult. This can complicate data analysis. As companies become more reliant on insights generated by this data, there will be no shortage of opportunities for data analytics professionals to use their skills and knowledge to organize that information and make it useful. There are efforts to organize these data lakes, but the amount of unstructured data within them requires the skills of data professionals to navigate.

The search for more effective methods to index unstructured data will continue, with the goal of optimization for data analytics.

Technology
Technology is ever-changing and adapting. There will continue to be opportunities for ongoing learning as data is made more accessible and the tools to analyze it continue to develop.

Considerations for the future
Artificial intelligence will continue to have a large impact on business, helping to streamline many areas. For example, an increase in sales is seen as a direct result of forecasting product demand. Artificial intelligence helps ensure warehouse supply, keep items in stock, reduce delivery time, and boost operational efficiency through automating processes.

Additionally, artificial intelligence will combine with machine learning, business intelligence and automation to deliver more personalized services to customers.

Offering additional services will push forward innovation, bringing computer applications and the sources of stored data closer together physically. This concept is referred to as edge computing. By closing the gap between data and computation, speed improves, resulting in greater support of real-time analytics and the automation necessary to support the increasing number of devices that are becoming linked through the internet (commonly referred to as internet of things). An increasing number of data analytics tasks will be automated by creating, managing, and analyzing data in edge environments. Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems are only as equitable and inclusive as the people who create and train these systems. You will learn more about how you, as a data analytics professional, will need to take steps to ensure equity in the future.

Business
Businesses will continue to rely on data driven decision making, fueled by both simple trend analyses and more complex techniques like predictive modeling and forecasting. Data analytics will continue as an essential function of business.

Considerations for the future
Despite the growth in data analytics in recent years, a majority of data collected is not analyzed. This largely has to do with the difficulty targeting specific data within the massive repositories of data. Innovations in accessing this data are leading to new approaches in making data interconnected.

This developing integration of data servers and cloud environments, involving systems that are smart and automated, is descriptively titled data fabric. The result of this integration is a method of connecting data from different environments that is making it easier to discover and access data. Data fabrics will provide more sources that can be accessed for data analytics.

The use of analytics to forecast business trends has transformed the way organizations plan for the future. The use of predictive analytics should continue to spread beyond business environments into fact-based decision-making institutions like government agencies, commercial entities and social organizations.

#Leverage data analysis in nonprofits
Recently, you've been learning about how businesses use data to guide decision-making, answer questions, and solve problems. In this video, we'll investigate how nonprofits to use data analysis to pursue their unique goals. Nonprofit groups are created to further a social cause or provide benefit to the public. As the name suggests, their main purpose is not about profit, but to foster a collective, public or social advantage. There are some very rewarding and inspiring opportunities for data professionals in the nonprofit sector. In particular, data can be applied in order to help these groups more effectively anticipate and respond to the greatest areas of need. For instance, maybe a US charity that provides bicycles for children would like to determine which neighborhoods are most in need. They could ask their data professional to access the US Census Bureau. The professional would use their talents to navigate the census database, identify key metrics, and summarize findings with analysis and data visualizations. This report would highlight where there are larger numbers of school-age children in need who would benefit from the resources of this program. There you go, data insights lead to inform decisions about where this nonprofit can do the most good. Now, nonprofits do more than use data. Many of them also collect it. As you likely know, public entities and government agencies can be excellent resources for useful data. Much of it is open data that's available for general use. As you likely know, open data is data that is available to the public. It's free to use, and guidance is provided to help navigate the data sets and acknowledge the source. While sourcing Open Data is a good way to interact with data on your own. There are other opportunities that enable you to refine your skills while helping others. Data volunteers contribute to many projects that help nonprofits benefit communities all over the world. To find out more, here are some organizations to check out. First, the Data Science for Social Good foundation was launched at the University of Chicago back in 2013. In 2020, they joined forces with UNICEF to analyze various aspects of air pollution around the world to help monitor children's health. DataKind launched in 2011 in New York City with chapters and the United Kingdom, Bengaluru, San Francisco, Singapore, and Washington DC. This organization analyzes the cost of environmental cleanup in different underserved communities to guide restorative efforts. You can view both foundations lays efforts through the links and the transcript for this video. Another option for putting your data skills to good use are hackathons. A hackathon is an event where data professionals and programmers come together and collaborate on a particular project. The goal is to create a solution to an existing problem using technology. Some examples include developing better tools for predicting extreme weather events, creating tech to help elementary school kids learn important reading skills, and identifying ways that community development groups can use their data to advance home accessibility and affordability. Volunteering your data skills to public projects is an excellent way to contribute to the greater good while gaining experience and networking with others in your field. Coming up, we'll take a deeper look at some data oriented projects in the public sector and how they're making an impact around the world.

# Volunteer data skills to make a positive impact
So far, you have been learning how data analytics professionals are making an impact in a variety of industries. You’ve also learned about nonprofit organizations, and how their efforts are making a difference for so many in need. By volunteering their expertise and time, data analytics professionals contribute to many projects that help nonprofits benefit communities all around the world. In this reading, you will learn more about how you can contribute to global efforts, including  your local community as a data professional.

Nonprofits
People hoping to further a social cause, or provide a benefit to the public, often create nonprofit groups. The main mission of a nonprofit group is to fill a need or gap that the private sector is not addressing adequately. There are rewarding and inspiring opportunities for data professionals in the nonprofit sector. At the global level, groups like Children International, Doctors Without Borders, and Care International lead humanitarian efforts across the globe. In addition to these large-scale efforts, there are many nonprofit organizations whose efforts are regionally specific, like Christopher’s Promise based in the Columbus, Ohio area.

You can apply your data skills to help nonprofit groups become more effective, allowing them to anticipate and respond to their greatest areas of need.

You may already be aware of nonprofits that fit within your areas of interest or operate in your community. One way that these organizations compensate for their lack of resources is by finding volunteers. Often, regional or local organizations lack the resources to offer full time employment for marketing professionals or data analysts. As a data analytics professional there are many ways that you can make a valuable contribution to nonprofit organizations. In the event that you do not have a specific nonprofit organization in mind, you can research through Charity Navigator, the largest and most trusted online nonprofit evaluation and rating tool in the world. Here you will find ratings on nearly 200,000 nonprofits.

An example of a community-based nonprofit organization
Christopher’s Promise, a grass-roots nonprofit based in Columbus, Ohio, is a representative example of the types of community-based nonprofits that are making an impact all over the world. This organization was inspired by the efforts to create a bicycle for a fifteen-year old who faced the challenges of Neurofibromatosis, Cerebral Palsy, and Optic Glioma. Since 2011, this nonprofit has facilitated the design and construction of adaptive bicycles for hundreds of children, thanks to outstanding support from the local communities in the central Ohio area.

Christopher’s Promise (2022) mission statement is  “To allow all kids, despite physical limitations, the ability to experience the same hallmark childhood memories as their peers. Helping kids, be kids.”

Volunteering data skills to nonprofits
As a data analytics professional, your skills can make a great impact on charity and nonprofit organizations within your own community or for a community whose needs resonate with you. Many nonprofits are highly dependent on volunteers for their activities due to limited resources. This situation is especially challenging for community-based initiatives that often lack the funding to hire data analytics professionals. Therefore, offering to volunteer with a local nonprofit is an excellent way to gain experience and support a cause.  

How can data analytics professionals help nonprofits?
Data analytics professionals can help nonprofit organizations in a variety of ways. Below are a few examples.

Fundraising
Using data analytics, you can predict with high accuracy which prospects are most likely to donate. In order to maximize return on marketing and outreach expenses, nonprofit organizations can use data analysis to prioritize outreach and reduce overall marketing expenditures.

Marketing
There is valuable information in a nonprofit’s data that can benefit marketing efforts. Data analysis can help determine a nonprofit’s target audience and gather insights such as donation methods, contribution history, and other demographics. As a result, the nonprofit can help guide communication with potential donors and determine the effectiveness of campaigns.

Monitoring activities
Data analysis can help nonprofits monitor resources, expenses, and daily operational needs. A nonprofit will often need assistance in keeping track of donated materials. For example, a database of donations to a food bank could help the organization determine specific food items being collected and inventory the expiration dates of food items for shelving, cycling, and distribution. Using a system of real-time inventory in conjunction with predictive data analytics could anticipate shortages and identify those donors who have helped provide these items in the past.

Data analytics has a lot to offer a nonprofit organization. Gaining deeper insight into the organization’s efforts can help them to operate in a more effective and efficient way. Analyzing data can improve various nonprofit functions, such as allocation of resources, recruiting and retaining supporters, fundraising, and conducting research. Data analysis also can help reveal patterns and power dynamics that can be used to inform decision-making. In addition to identifying individuals and communities in need of assistance, predictive modeling can also be used to identify potential recipients of a nonprofit's services.

More opportunities to volunteer
There are organizations who are helping to pair data professionals with projects that are making a difference all around the world.

DataKind is a global nonprofit that harnesses the power of data science and artificial intelligence (“AI”) in the service of humanity. Using data analysis, this organization guides restorative efforts in underserved communities.

There are many hackathon events scheduled across the world each year. These events can take place at a specific location or remotely across the globe. Hackathon events are commonly built around a central theme or question, such as tracking industrial emissions, promoting healthy food options, or how we can improve mental health for cancer patients. If you are interested in finding listings of current hackathons around the world, visit Devpost.com.

Key takeaways
Donating your time to a nonprofit is a great way to gain experience, and it can be mutually beneficial for you and the nonprofit. The nonprofit benefits from your data analysis expertise, and you get valuable experience working with data that can be added to your professional portfolio.

Working with a nonprofit organization or participating in a hackathon event introduces you to different types of projects, enhances interpersonal and communications skills, and adds to your professional list of contacts. No matter what your level of data analytics experience, working with nonprofits and hackathons can be a rewarding side project, or even a philanthropic career option.

# Important ethical considerations for data professionals
One of the most important responsibilities for those of us in data-centered careers involves how we protect our organizations, manage and protect data. This has a lot to do with communication exchanges between a company and its customers. As you've been learning, almost all communication generates data, whether it's a shopping receipt, confirmation of an order, or even earning customer loyalty points. Businesses have a big responsibility to their customers, especially when it comes to maintaining and protecting user privacy. Any data gathered from individuals or consumers is referred to as personally identifiable information or PII. PII permits the identity of an individual to be inferred by either direct or indirect means. This includes things like biometric records, usernames, and Social Security or national identification numbers. Because this information is often associated with medical, financial, and employment records, PII is sensitive and must be managed with great care. After all, when someone's personal data is improperly handled, they become vulnerable to identity theft, fraud, and other issues. Recently, there have been great efforts to take a wider view of data collection practices and protect individuals. Industries are trending towards aggregate information. This is data from a significant number of users that has eliminated personal information. By aggregating the data and removing PII, this protects people and gives them more control over their own data. Similarly, as more industries become interconnected, the amount of data available to them increases. Just as with aggregate information, the more data collected, the more likely it is that it will be representative of a wider population rather than a single user. A key thing to keep in mind is that data gathering is a task managed by humans, and that process can be informed by different backgrounds, experiences, beliefs, and worldviews. These and other types of biases can affect the way that data is communicated and how the results are shared, which in turn can have an impact on business decisions. Effective data professionals know that, whether collecting, analyzing, interpreting, or communicating sensitive data, bias should always be considered. So be very careful when interpreting data where there is a clear source of bias and be on the lookout for subtle biases as well. In addition to thinking through bias in the data, data professionals should also try to emphasize that there can be a multitude of possible interpretations for every data insight. The main trick is avoid jumping to conclusions until you've really done your homework. One method of addressing bias is to make sure that the data that you're working with has the same characteristics as the greater population that you're interested in. In data analytics, this is called a sample. A good sample is a segment of a population that is representative of that entire population. Here's an example. A clothing company is analyzing sales in their highest growth market. They want to determine what color shirts will be most popular in the upcoming season. One person notes that red and blue shirts accounted for 80 percent of their sales in this market over the past three months. This is a big number. So they suggest ordering lots of red and blue shirts, but another person points out that the local sports team's colors are red and blue, and this team had recently won a championship. It's very likely that sales of red and blue shirts will have spiked as consumers purchase tease to support the local team. Plus, they note that although this market is high-growth, it only represents 40 percent of the retailer's total sales. With all this information in mind, decision-makers at this retailer instead choose to evaluate color popularity over a full year and across all markets. This will provide a much more complete picture. We'll investigate more about bias later in this program, and as you progress, you'll discover many more strategies for ensuring that you're aware of bias and proactively working to counter it in all of your data work.

# Critical data security and privacy principles
You have learned how data analytics can be used for good causes, like assisting nonprofit organizations. Also, you learned that data professionals need to protect privacy within data and remain aware of other considerations, like data bias and making assumptions about data.

As a data analytics professional, you have a responsibility to handle data ethically. Data ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used. Throughout your career you will work with a lot of data. This sometimes includes PII, or personally identifiable information, which can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. One element of treating data ethically is ensuring that the privacy and security of that data is maintained throughout its lifetime. In this reading, you will learn more about the importance of data privacy and some strategies for protecting the privacy of data subjects.

Privacy matters
Data privacy means preserving a data subject’s information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. This is also called information privacy or data protection. Data privacy is concerned with the access, use, and collection of personal data. For the people whose data is being collected, this means they have the right to:

Protection from unauthorized access to their private data

Freedom from inappropriate use of their data

The right to inspect, update, or correct their data

Ability to give consent to data collection

Legal right to access the data

In order to maintain these rights, businesses and organizations have to put privacy measures in place to protect individuals’ data. This is also a matter of trust. The public’s ability to trust companies with personal data is important. It’s what makes people want to use a company’s product, share their information, and more.

Protecting privacy with data anonymization
An illustration of eraser wiping away data from a webpage on a laptop screen
Organizations use a lot of different measures to protect the privacy of their data subjects, like incorporating access permissions to ensure that only the people who are supposed to access that information can do so. Another key strategy to maintaining privacy is data anonymization.

Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.

Data professionals can take additional measures to protect users and their data. Data aggregation, for example, is the process of collecting and combining details from a significant number of users in terms of totals or summary. Aggregating data ensures that information contained within datasets is shown in groups; when coupled with other anonymization techniques, data professionals can ensure compliance with data privacy and anonymization standards.

Data anonymization is used in just about every industry. As a data analytics professional, you probably won’t personally be performing anonymization, but it’s useful to understand what kinds of data are often anonymized before you start working with it. This data might include:

Telephone numbers

Names

License plates and license numbers

Social security numbers

Imagine a world where we all had access to each other’s addresses, account numbers, and other identifiable information. That would invade a lot of people’s privacy and make the world less safe. Data anonymization is one of the ways we can help keep data private and secure!

# The future of data careers
When investigating a possible new career path, one of the most important things to consider is its outlook and potential for growth. Predictions about careers related to data analysis show that there is no shortage of need for professionals in this field. Over the last decade, data focused careers have surged. According to estimates by Linkedin, the data science field grew by over 650% between 2012 and 2017. Many experts believe that we have not yet seen the full potential of these careers. In fact, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that data science is one of the fastest growing career fields in the United States projecting a 30% increase over the next decade. Among the data science professions, one of the fastest growing is artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we've seen significant advances in these areas in recent years. At its core, artificial intelligence or AI is the development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Thanks to growth in the data sciences, AI is now becoming more commonplace. These technologies will continue to evolve and provide more accurate results and richer insights. And as AI increasingly becomes an essential component of data work, it's important to be aware of the human bias that can be imprinted within your work. To counter this, organizations benefit most from building diverse teams of professionals from different backgrounds and different life experiences. Incorporating a wide range of perspectives and worldviews promotes wider representation and yields more accurate results. As we study the future of the data professions, I want to emphasize that data professionals have yet to realize the full potential of artificial intelligence. As these types of technological innovations continue to evolve, we can expect that organizations will grow and adapt their business practices accordingly. With wider and wider adoption of data analysis techniques, the most likely area for growth is in specialization. And we expect to see further subdivision of roles within data focused teams. Ultimately, what I want you to keep in mind is this, the world is generating more and more data every year. So it's reasonable to expect labor that extracts business value from it to be able to earn its keep. More data means more demand for the three main activities covered by the data professions, statistical inference, machine learning, and data analytics. So those skills will stay very relevant though their names might evolve over time. In addition, constant innovation in the field offers you the opportunity for perpetual learning, growth, and development. As you may already know, being a data professional means that your growth and success in this field depend on a desire to keep learning. In fact, that just might be the reason you enrolled in this program, and for that, I'm so proud of you. Continue to explore opportunities to evolve throughout your career, be proactive in acquiring new skills, keep growing, and you will always be ready for the future.

# The practices and principles of good data stewardship
As you have been learning, all data professionals are responsible for ensuring the quality, integrity, accessibility, and security of data. Data stewardship is the practice of ensuring that data is accessible, usable, and safe. Making data stewardship a normal part of your work habits will benefit everyone who relies on your analysis, both inside and outside of your organization. In this reading, you will learn more about data stewardship and receive some best practices that can assist in guiding your career in data analytics.

Respect privacy
Earlier in this course, you learned about Information that permits the identity of an individual to be inferred by either direct or indirect means. This kind of information is commonly referred to as personally identifiable information or PII. When users share personal information, they are putting a high level of trust into an organization. It is the responsibility of all who have access within the organization to help protect the privacy of their users. As a data analytics professional, it is important to be thoughtful about any personal data and exhibit great care to protect it. In different parts of the world, laws are in place to guide best practices for data privacy. Laws provide a foundation for best practices as you grow in knowledge and experience on how to support and sustain privacy. One of your responsibilities as a data professional will be to stay up to date with any change in data laws and regulations that govern data. Depending on your organization’s location or industry considerations, there may be additional regulations and policies in place. Here are a couple of regional examples:

General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR (European Union law):

The GDPR is described on their website as the toughest privacy and security law in the world. It imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the European Union.

Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais or LGPD (Brazil’s general law for the protection of personal data):

The LGPD is a data protection law that governs how companies collect, use, disclose, and process personal data belonging to people in Brazil. LGPD applies to companies that process data about individuals in Brazil.

The California Consumers Privacy Act or CCPA (Privacy rights for California consumers):

The CCPA gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them. These regulations provide guidance on how to implement the law.

Additionally, states like Virginia, Colorado, New York, Utah, and Connecticut have enacted similar legislation to protect consumer privacy in their states.

Be cautious of unintentional harm
Data analytics is expanding its influence across an increasing range of industries. Companies are using the results of data analysis to make informed decisions. Many of these decisions have the potential to impact people across a broad range of social and economic factors. It is good practice to continually strive to produce information that is accurate, while respecting cultural and social norms.

Due to the global marketplace, decisions play out differently in different cultures. Taking these issues and considerations into account is very important for the executive team of an organization. Also, companies are known to take a position on particular politicized social and cultural issues, and these can be reflected in their policies. As a data analytics professional, you must be cognizant of your company’s policies. When presented with challenges, it is best to seek guidance from leadership within your organization on how to navigate.

Avoid creating or reinforcing bias
You have learned about bias within data and how it can have an impact on your analysis. Identifying bias is not always simple. A good practice when working with data is to keep in mind that data gathering is a task managed by humans–and that process is informed by people from different backgrounds, experiences, beliefs, and worldviews. These and other types of biases can affect the data and the results, which in turn can have an impact on business decisions. You will learn more about bias within data as you progress through the program.

Consider inclusivity
Often In your role as a data analytics professional, you will have access to data collected in a variety of ways. You will need to consider whether the methods of data collection have excluded information from particular populations. Inclusionary approaches can expand how any organization collects and analyzes data. Building diverse research teams, communicating clearly with user communities, and engaging in careful and critical analysis that considers equity and inclusion benefits all stakeholders.

Uphold high standards of scientific excellence
The processes and technology that you will interact with as a data analytics professional are deeply rooted in the scientific method. As you continue in your data professional journey, embrace inquiry, intellectual discussion, and collaboration. Invite feedback and assess feedback. Remember, artificial intelligence still depends heavily on the instructions provided by data professionals. The more time and consideration that goes into the process of data analytics, the better the results.

Different industries have different standards. In your role as a data analytical professional, you will need to be aware of the standards for the industries you are working in. Each industry will have its own standards based on industry conventions.

Conventions that work well in the transportation industry may not necessarily be as high of a priority for the healthcare industry. For example, in transportation, data is collected to create predictive analytics models to analyze the best route based on traffic patterns. In the healthcare industry, data is analyzed in medical imaging, predicting genetic factors, and speeding up the development of treatments.
