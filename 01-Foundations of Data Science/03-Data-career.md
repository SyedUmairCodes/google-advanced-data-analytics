# The top skills needed for a data career
All data professionals share a love of data and a desire to solve problems. While wearing their analytics hat, data professionals lay out the story that they're tempted to tell. Then they poke it from several angles with follow-up investigations to see if it holds water before bringing it to their decision-makers. In doing so, they rely on their programming and investigative skills to guide others towards informed decisions. Data professionals also combine a knowledge about how to do practical tasks with an awareness of what makes communication and collaboration successful. Later, we'll dig deeper into the elements of communication and discuss the ways communication enhances and structures your work as a data professional. For now, let's examine some skills and attributes that are applicable across data-driven careers. Working in data analytics requires a mix of business sense and knowledge in gathering, manipulating, and analyzing data. Our goal is to prepare you to develop the competencies needed to succeed. Let's start by discussing some interpersonal skills. Often, these are referred to as people's skills. They focus on communicating and building relationships. Interpersonal skills are critical. In this field, there's a high degree of interaction between stakeholders. This is especially relevant now with team members often working collaboratively across the globe. Very often, work conversations are the starting point and the fuel that drives projects. Because of the cyclical processes within data analysis, communication is always ongoing. Another important skill is active listening. This means allowing team members, bosses, and other collaborative stakeholders, to share their own points of view before offering responses so that each exchange improves mutual understanding. You can actually practice active listening. Next time you speak with someone, put extra effort into listening beyond their words. Focus on what they're trying to communicate. Your listening and communication skills will play a huge role in helping you capture effective insights and informed decisions. We'll take a closer look at communication a little later in this course. There are other things you'll need to consider. As a data professional, you'll search for information hidden within a large amounts of data by applying critical thinking skills. Along the way, you'll investigate the connections between a variety of different data sources, as you search for trends and indicators. Think of yourself as a data detective. Project data can come directly from your organization or from other sources. You might be lucky and receive a well-formatted spreadsheet or database, but quite often, you will need to prepare the data to get started. This process is known as data cleaning. This is where the data is reorganized and reformatted. The goal is to remove anything that could create an error during analysis. This process includes tagging and consolidating duplicates, irrelevant entries, structural errors, and empty space. Once you have everything in the proper format, you can then filter out unwanted material. Now, your data is ready to be analyzed. It's time to look for trends and tendencies. Often it's very helpful to render the data visually to reveal additional insights through charts, dashboards and reports. Graphic tools be very useful in identifying patterns, as well as in sharing information with others. You will explore this in greater detail later and have opportunities to practice compiling visualizations too. You'll also learn about more advanced skills like building models and machine learning algorithms. These tools will help you and other data professionals assess information accuracy, analyze specific data segments, and predict future business outcomes. Your hard work will assist leaders and other decision-makers in your company, providing them access to a rich variety of perspectives on different sets of information. With demand for data analytics increasing across all types of companies and businesses, you will likely find opportunities in an industry that you are personally interested in. Next, we'll take a look at working in the data field.

# Ideal qualities for data analytics professionals
You have been learning about skills that can help you enter and excel in the data career space. In this program, you will be building technical abilities, which are necessary before pursuing opportunities in data analytics. Job postings will include a list of the required technical skills prominently displayed. Quite often, organizations will also make note of additional skills and traits that go beyond working with data on a computer. In this reading, you will explore examples of additional skills and traits that employers are seeking when searching for data analytics professionals.

As you begin to search for job opportunities, many employers seek additional skills that are not exclusive to digital fields. In the sections below, you will learn more about these traits through excerpts found within data analytics job postings.

Being coachable
Coachable individuals are capable of receiving feedback and using that information to make improvements. At the center of being coachable is a positive attitude, and the ability to self-reflect and take steps to grow. People who are coachable usually have a growth mindset, which is a belief that hard work and determination can make them better. As a result, they view feedback from colleagues and supervisors as an opportunity to improve their skill set.

A passion for data analysis
Employers often seek candidates whose commitment to data analysis extends beyond their professional duties. Volunteering your data skills to help a nonprofit organization is just one example, but it’s not the only way to show your commitment to data analytics. Data analysis is applicable outside of the workplace, but is often not obvious. Community projects, helping a local school organize data, and developing your own side project are a few examples of how you might demonstrate your passion for data analysis outside of the workplace.

Another way to explore your passion for data analysis is to connect with other passionate data analysts and take on data challenges. A great website for exploring data analytics is Kaggle.com, which hosts an active online community for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. Users can collaborate with other users, publish datasets, use GPU-integrated notebooks, and compete with other data scientists to solve data science challenges. Participating in activities hosted by an online data science community like Kaggle can add fuel to your passion for data analysis and provide artifacts for your portfolio.

Employers are seeking passionate candidates. Job postings that identify candidates that have a passion for data analysis often include language like:

Throughout a project, a data analyst will interact with many stakeholders, from different areas of an organization. Often, these interactions will extend to include clients, users, or representatives from other companies. Additionally, data professionals will work closely with a variety of other professionals as a member of a cross-functional team. Examples from job postings include interpersonal skill requirements for candidates and will include these types of statements:
